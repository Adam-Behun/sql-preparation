# SQL Practice Repository

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of my SQL solutions, primarily from challenges on HackerRank. 

## Advanced SQL Practices

In my journey to deepen my SQL expertise, I've added the `analytical-data-processing-sql` folder, which contains a series of advanced SQL queries and data processing techniques as learned from [Book Title]. These exercises are a part of my ongoing efforts to master data analysis through SQL.

Check out the [analytical-data-processing-sql](/analytical-data-processing-sql) folder for detailed examples and explanations.
